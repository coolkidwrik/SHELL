To use this, call startup.sh in your .zshrc or .bashrc file in your root directory. When opening up your shell for the first time, it will run the script.
<pre>
    <code>
        # can be added to .zshrc

        # execute the following code on terminal startup
        ###################################
        ./startup/startup.sh
    </code>
</pre>

here is how it looks when startup is run on open:
